        "info": "Situated in northern England, Hadrian's Wall is 73 miles long, making it one of the most majestic monuments in Britain. A Roman emperor ordered to build off this wall back in AD 122, and it was named after him. Originally, the wall was supposed to create a physical division between the Scottish Picts and the Romans. Over the years, its significance has been limited to a tourist destination since it's a UNESCO World Heritage site. While hiking along the path, you'll see forts, museums, and several ancient settlements, hinting at the presence of Roman ancestry. If you're enthusiastic, walk up to the highest point between Birdoswald Fort and Chollerford. From here, you can see the Lake District and marvel at the area's natural beauty. If you want to give your legs a break, stop at the Roman Army Museum and watch the exhibit showing the history of the Wall. I know this place since my dad took me to travel over there. It really was an amazing experience when I was 12. After that, I traveled so many times over there. I know every single point of that trail. So it could be a great adventure for you. "

        "info": "Have you ever dreamed of riding a horse along miles of golden sandy beaches? Imagine feeling a cool breeze blowing in your face; the ocean gently laps on the sand. Gradually, you allow your hands to grip the reins and your legs to tighten in the stirrups. You pat your friendly horse reassuringly before galloping off into the sunset. I know this feeling because I used to go to Ireland on vacation when I was 22. It's really an amazing experience to ride a horse over there. I know every place where you should travel at least for one time in Ireland!"

        "info": "Few places in the world offer the incredible freedom and scenic beauty of cycling on the Big Island of Hawaii. Bicycle routes on the Big Island are as ubiquitous as the roads, with a new adventure around every turn. While there are few places to go wrong on the island, some trips are safer and more enjoyable than others. I have noticeable experience riding a bicycle in Hawaii. It's an amazing moment to ride and see the beauty of that island! The tour will take 14 hours long to make the endpoint."

        "info": "Nepal is one of the most beautiful places on the earth just because of its bounty and the Himalayan range. The presence of Mount Everest in Nepal is enough to double the economy of the country. The best time to visit Nepal for mountaineering, trekking, climbing, and sightseeing can be from March to April and from September to December. Visitors can visit this place during the time of the winter season because the sight of snowfall is exquisite and vibrant. Sometimes due to weather conditions, problems can happen otherwise it's all right. My soft corner at a few climb spots in Nepal. They are Kala Patthar, Island Peak, Mt. Ama Dablam, and Mera Peak. The view from those mountains is mindblowing. I used to travel to Nepal during the winter season."
